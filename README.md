Twitbak
-------

This is a super-simple python script which uses Twitter's user_timeline API to fetch tweets and store them into local txt file (well, tsv actually) twitbak.txt. Run twitbak.py --help for some insight -- fully-fledged README coming soon.

Originally inspired by Zach Holman [http://zachholman.com/2010/09/hey-twitter-give-us-our-tweets/]

Work in progress.
